I approach photography with a romantic, impressionist sensibility. Over the past decade, I have had the pleasure of documenting some of the most iconic and exclusive celebrations
for discerning patrons in over twenty countries and six continents. Moreover, I have had the pleasure of capturing some of the most breathtaking landscapes while travelling the world.
I have been named one of the top film photographers in the world and featured in numerous prestigious publications 
such as Harpers Bazaar, Elle, Town & Country and National Geopgraphic. 
<br><br><br>
My intricate use of colour palettes is what differentiates me from other artists in my field. As is to be seen on my self-portrait on the left, mixing bold, yet reassuring hues with 
gentle, but assertive ones brings out the most in what is being captured. Every detail reflects a background experience unknown to the beholder. Such fantastic freedom of expression
has been motivation me for the last 8 years, since I started engaging in photography activities.
<br><br><br>
My luminous imagery is understated, yet evocative, resulting from clear and polished creative direction and 
an exceptional eye for beauty. My fresh and simple composition, and use of natural light has evolved from a deep love and respect for the art and craft of shooting film. My clients 
describe my work as “painterly,” “nuanced,” “refined” and I am honored to be a leading choice amongst internationally acclaimed photographers.
<br><br><br>
Dive deep into this world of mine.
